	abstract = {Sediment influx to channel networks is stochastically driven by rainstorms and other perturbations, which are discrete in time and space and which occur on a landscape with its own spatial variability in topography, colluvium properties, and state of recovery from previous disturbances. The resulting stochastic field of sediment supply interacts with the topology of the channel network and with transport processes to generate spatial and temporal patterns of flux and storage that characterize the sedimentation regime of a drainage basin. The regime varies systematically with basin area. We describe how the stochastic sediment supply is generated by climatic, topographic, geotechnical, and biotic controls that vary between regions. The general principle is illustrated through application to a landscape where sediment is supplied by mass wasting, and the forcing variables are deterministic thickening of colluvium, random sequences of root-destroying wildfires, and random sequences of rainstorms that trigger failure in a population of landslide source areas with spatial variance in topography and colluvium strength. Landslides stop in channels or convert to scouring debris flows, depending on the nature of the low-order channel network. Sediment accumulates within these channels for centuries before being transferred downstream by debris flows. Time series of sediment supply, transport, and storage vary with basin scale for any combination of climatic, topographic, and geotechnical controls. In a companion paper [Benda and Dunne, this issue] we use simulations of timing, volumes, and locations of mass wasting to study the interaction between a stochastically forced sediment supply and systematic changes of storage and flux through channel networks.},

	abstract = {Species descriptions of most alcyonacean octocorals rely heavily on the morphology of sclerites, the calcium carbonate spicules embedded in the soft tissue. Sclerites provide taxonomic characters for species delineation but require qualitative descriptions, which introduce ambiguities in recognizing morphological features. Elliptical Fourier analysis of the outline of sclerites was used to quantify the morphology of eight species of gorgoniid octocoral in the genus Pseudopterogorgia. Sclerites from one to seven colonies of each species were compared. Scaphoids and spindles were examined separately; rods and octoradiates were excluded from the analyses because of their morphologic similarity across all species. Discriminant analysis of elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs) was used to determine whether the elliptical Fourier analysis could be used to identify the specimens. Sclerites were highly variable even within a single colony. Correct species assignments of individual sclerites were greater than 50\% for both scaphoids and spindles. Species assignments based on averages of the EFDs for each colony approached 90\%. Elliptical Fourier analysis quantifies morphological differences between species and measures colony variance in sclerite size and shape among colonies and species. Phylogenetic analysis based on EFDs did not capture monophyletic groups. The quantification of complex shapes such as sclerites provides an important tool in alpha taxonomy but may be less useful in phylogenetic analyses.},

	abstract = {Fluvial landscapes are dissected by channels, and at their upstream termini are channel heads. Accurate reconstruction of the fluvial domain is fundamental to understanding runoff generation, storm hydrology, sediment transport, biogeochemical cycling, and landscape evolution. Many methods have been proposed for predicting channel head locations using topographic data, yet none have been tested against a robust field data set of mapped channel heads across multiple landscapes. In this study, four methods of channel head prediction were tested against field data from four sites with high-resolution DEMs: slope-area scaling relationships; two techniques based on landscape tangential curvature; and a new method presented here, which identifies the change from channel to hillslope topography along a profile using a transformed longitudinal coordinate system. Our method requires only two user-defined parameters, determined via independent statistical analysis. Slope-area plots are traditionally used to identify the fluvial-hillslope transition, but we observe no clear relationship between this transition and field-mapped channel heads. Of the four methods assessed, one of the tangential curvature methods and our new method most accurately reproduce the measured channel heads in all four field sites (Feather River CA, Mid Bailey Run OH, Indian Creek OH, Piedmont VA), with mean errors of −11, −7, 5, and −24 m and 34, 3, 12, and −58 m, respectively. Negative values indicate channel heads located upslope of those mapped in the field. Importantly, these two independent methods produce mutually consistent estimates, providing two tests of channel head locations based on independent topographic signatures.},

	abstract = {The appearance of agricultural products deeply conditions their marketing. Appearance is normally evaluated by considering size, shape, form, colour, freshness condition and finally the absence of visual defects. Among these features, the shape plays a crucial role. Description of agricultural product shape is often necessary in research fields for a range of different purposes, including the investigation of shape traits heritability for cultivar descriptions, plant variety or cultivar patents and evaluation of consumer decision performance. This review reports the main applications of shape analysis on agricultural products such as relationships between shape and: (1) genetic; (2) conformity and condition ratios; (3) products characterization; (4) product sorting and finally, (5) clone selection. Shape can be a protagonist of evaluation criteria only if an appreciable level of image shape processing and automation and data are treated with solid multivariate statistic. In this context, image-processing algorithms have been increasingly developed in the last decade in order to objectively measure the external features of agricultural products. Grading and sorting of agricultural products using machine vision in conjunction with pattern recognition techniques offers many advantages over the conventional optical or mechanical sorting devices. With this aims, we propose a new automated shape processing system which could be useful for both scientific and industrial purposes, forming the bases of a common language for the scientific community. We applied such a processing scheme to morphologically discriminate nuts fruit of different species. Operative Matlab codes for shape analysis are reported.},

	abstract = {Blood orange cultivars of the sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] differ from the common sweet orange group (Valencia Late, Washington navel, Navelina) by the presence in the flesh and sometimes in the rind, of red anthocyanin pigments. Among blood orange varieties, Tarocco is the most variable due to its particular characteristics. The presence of several Tarocco varieties, often characterized by similar maturation periods, necessitates accurate postharvest fruit evaluation, particularly appearance, since this is a primary criterion of consumer preference. In this work a total of 929 fruit belonging to 17 different Tarocco genotypes were analyzed. Optoelectronic techniques were used to discriminate among fruit shapes using elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) to analyse fruit lateral shapes. Fruit shape for different genotypes was classified according to the IPGRI e Citrus Industry classification. The efficiency of these methods was tested by reclassifying fruit shape typologies by k-means analysis. We also computed the best number of k (4) by implementing a suited script in MatLab. Results were screened by multivariate classification techniques (i.e., PSLDA) in order to evaluate the efficiency of the group classifications. The combined EFA and k-means analysis increased the efficiency of genotype classification based on fruit shape in comparison with reported descriptive methods. For example, comparing the two models with 5 groups (Citrus Industry and k-means-5), the percentage of correct classification in the independent test dataset was higher in the k-means-5 model (respectively, 46.6\% vs. 26.0\% compared to a random probability of classification of 20\%). EFA could measure single fruit shape allowing the comparison of their conformity within a standard of reference. The results set the basis for a shape description of different Tarocco varieties based on quantitative morphological statistics, a practice that, until now, has been carried out exclusively in a descriptive fashion. Consequently, our work represents the first discrimination of genetically different cultivars of the same species based on fruit shape.},

	abstract = {Elliptic Fourier shape analysis is a powerful, though under-utilized, biometric tool that is particularly suited for the description of fossils lacking many homologous landmarks, such as several common bivalve groups. The method is conceptually more parsimonious than more traditional biometric methods based on discrete linear and angular measurements. Most importantly, however, shape analysis captures a much higher proportion of the morphological information resident in any fossil than analyses based on discrete measurements. The number of harmonics required in an elliptic Fourier analysis can be estimated from a series of inverse Fourier reconstructions, or from the power spectrum. In most studies it is appropriate to normalize Fourier coefficients for size, although this information can be reincorporated at a later stage. The coefficients should probably not be standardized, unless there is evidence to suggest that high-frequency information was genetically as important as low-frequency information. Depending upon the aims of a particular study and the morphological disparity of the fossils in question, it might be appropriate to eliminate the first harmonic (‘best-fitting’) ellipse from an analysis. Meaningful comparison of the left and right valves of bivalves requires the digitized coordinates of one or other to be mirrored prior to computation of the Fourier coefficients. □Biometric analysis, Bivalvia, elliptic Fourier analysis, morphometrics.},

The objective was to automatically and objectively classify points within unclassified LiDAR point clouds, with few model parameters and minimal postprocessing.

Multiscale curvature classification (MCC) is an iterative multiscale algorithm for classifying LiDAR returns that exceed positive surface curvature thresholds, resulting in all the LiDAR measurements being classified as ground or nonground. The MCC algorithm yields a solution of classified returns that support bare-earth surface interpolation at a resolution commensurate with the sampling frequency of the LiDAR survey. Errors in classified ground returns were assessed using 204 independent validation points consisting of 165 field plot global positioning system locations and 39 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Geodetic Survey monuments. Jackknife validation and Monte Carlo simulation were used to assess the quality and error of a bare-earth digital elevation model interpolated from the classified returns. A local indicator of spatial association statistic was used to test for commission errors in the classified ground returns. Results demonstrate that the MCC model minimizes commission errors while retaining a high proportion of ground returns and provides high confidence in the derived ground surface},

	abstract = {Hillslope length is a fundamental attribute of landscapes, intrinsically linked to drainage density, landslide hazard, biogeochemical cycling and hillslope sediment transport. Existing methods to estimate catchment average hillslope lengths include inversion of drainage density or identification of a break in slope–area scaling, where the hillslope domain transitions into the fluvial domain. Here we implement a technique which models flow from point sources on hilltops across pixels in a digital elevation model (DEM), based on flow directions calculated using pixel aspect, until reaching the channel network, defined using recently developed channel extraction algorithms. Through comparisons between these measurement techniques, we show that estimating hillslope length from plots of topographic slope versus drainage area, or by inverting measures of drainage density, systematically underestimates hillslope length. In addition, hillslope lengths estimated by slope–area scaling breaks show large variations between catchments of similar morphology and area. We then use hillslope length–relief structure of landscapes to explore nature of sediment flux operating on a landscape. Distinct topographic forms are predicted for end-member sediment flux laws which constrain sediment transport on hillslopes as being linearly or nonlinearly dependent on hillslope gradient. Because our method extracts hillslope profiles originating from every ridgetop pixel in a DEM, we show that the resulting population of hillslope length–relief measurements can be used to differentiate between linear and nonlinear sediment transport laws in soil mantled landscapes. We find that across a broad range of sites across the continental United States, topography is consistent with a sediment flux law in which transport is nonlinearly proportional to topographic gradient. © 2016 The Authors.

	abstract = {Shallow landslides are a significant hazard in steep, soil-mantled landscapes. During intense rainfall events, the distribution of shallow landslides is controlled by variations in landscape gradient, the frictional and cohesive properties of soil and roots, and the subsurface hydrologic response. While gradients can be estimated from digital elevation models, information on soil and root properties remains sparse. We investigated whether geomorphically controlled variations in ecology affect the spatial distribution of root cohesion by measuring the distribution and tensile strength of roots from soil pits dug downslope of 15 native trees in the southern Appalachian Mountains, North Carolina, United States. Root tensile strengths from different hardwood tree species were similar and consistently higher than the only native shrub species measured (Rhododendron maximum). Roots were stronger in trees found on noses (areas of divergent topography) relative to those in hollows (unchanneled, convergent topography) coincident with the variability in cellulose content. This cellulose variability is likely related to topographic differences in soil water potential. For all species, roots were concentrated close to the soil surface, with roots in hollows being more evenly distributed in the soil column than those on noses. Trees located on noses had higher mean root cohesion than those in hollows because of a higher root tensile force. R. maximum had the shallowest, weakest roots suggesting that recent expansion of this species due to fire suppression has likely lowered the root cohesion of some hollows. Quantification of this feedback between physiologic controls on root growth and slope hydrology has allowed us to create a curvature-based model of root cohesion that is a significant improvement on current models that assume a spatially averaged value.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of sediment generation and transport on hillslopes provides important constraints on the rate of sediment output from orogenic systems. Hillslope sediment fluxes are recorded by organic material found in the deposits infilling unchanneled convergent topographic features called hollows. This study describes the first hollow infilling rates measured in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Infilling rates (and bedrock erosion rates) were calculated from the vertical distribution of radiocarbon ages at two sites in the Coweeta drainage basin, western North Carolina. At each site we dated paired charcoal and silt soil organic matter samples from five different horizons. Paired radiocarbon samples were used to bracket the age of the soil material in order to capture the range of complex soil forming processes and deposition within the hollows. These dates constrain hillslope erosion rates of between 0.051 and 0.111 mm yr− 1. These rates are up to 4 times higher than spatially-averaged rates for the Southern Appalachian Mountains making creep processes one of the most efficient erosional mechanisms in this mountain range. Our hillslope erosion rates are consistent with those of forested mountain ranges in the western United States, suggesting that the mechanisms (dominantly tree throw) driving creep erosion in both the western United States and the Southern Appalachian Mountains are equally effective.},

The corresponding relation of a provisional label and its representative label is recorded in a table. Whenever different connected components are found to be connected, all provisional label sets concerned with these connected components are merged together, and the smallest provisional label is taken as the representative label. When the first scan is finished, all provisional labels that were assigned to each connected component in the given image will have a unique representative label.

	abstract = {Erosion rates dictate the morphology of landscapes, and therefore quantifying them is a critical part of many geomorphic studies. Methods to directly measure erosion rates are expensive and time consuming, whereas topographic analysis facilitates prediction of erosion rates rapidly and over large spatial extents. If hillslope sediment flux is nonlinearly dependent on slope then the curvature of hilltops will be linearly proportional to erosion rates. In this contribution we develop new techniques to extract hilltop networks and sample their adjacent hillslopes in order to test the utility of hilltop curvature for estimating erosion rates using high-resolution (1 m) digital elevation data. Published and new cosmogenic radionuclide analyses in the Feather River basin, California, suggest that erosion rates vary by over an order of magnitude (10 to 250 mm kyr−1). Hilltop curvature increases with erosion rates, allowing calibration of the hillslope sediment transport coefficient, which controls the relationship between gradient and sediment flux. Having constraints on sediment transport efficiency allows estimation of erosion rates throughout the landscape by mapping the spatial distribution of hilltop curvature. Additionally, we show that hilltop curvature continues to increase with rising erosion rates after gradient-limited hillslopes have emerged. Hence hilltop curvature can potentially reflect higher erosion rates than can be predicted by hillslope gradient, providing soil production on hilltops can keep pace with erosion. Finally, hilltop curvature can be used to estimate erosion rates in landscapes undergoing a transient adjustment to changing boundary conditions if the response timescale of hillslopes is short relative to channels.},

	abstract = {Artifact depressions in digital elevation models (DEMs) interrupt flow paths and alter drainage directions. Techniques for removing depressions should enforce continuous flow paths in a way that requires the least modification of the DEM. Impacts on the spatial and statistical distributions of elevation and its derivatives were assessed for four methods of removing depressions: (1) filling; (2) breaching; (3) a combination of filling and breaching, with breaching constrained to a maximum of two grid cells; (4) a combination of filling and breaching based on an impact reduction approach (IRA). The IRA removes each depression using either filling or breaching, depending on which method has the least impact, in terms of the number of modified cells and the mean absolute difference in the DEM. Analysis of a LiDAR DEM of a landscape on the Canadian Shield showed significant differences in the impacts among the four depression removal methods. Depression filling, a removal method that is widely implemented in geographical information system software, was found to impact terrain attributes most severely. Constrained breaching, which relies heavily on filling for larger depressions, also performed poorly. Both depression breaching and the IRA impacted spatial and statistical distributions of terrain attributes less than depression filling and constrained breaching. The most sensitive landscapes to depression removal were those that contained large (i.e. {\textgreater}10\%) flat areas, because of the occurrence of relatively large depressions in these areas.

Using LiDAR data for digital elevation model (DEM) generation is becoming a standard practice in spatial related areas. However, the effective processing of the raw LiDAR data and the generation of an efficient and high-quality DEM remain big challenges. This paper reviews the recent advances of airborne LiDAR systems and the use of LiDAR data for DEM generation, with special focus on LiDAR data filters, interpolation methods, DEM resolution, and LiDAR data reduction. Separating LiDAR points into ground and non-ground is the most critical and difficult step for DEM generation from LiDAR data. Commonly used and most recently developed LiDAR filtering methods are presented. Interpolation methods and choices of suitable interpolator and DEM resolution for LiDAR DEM generation are discussed in detail. In order to reduce the data redundancy and increase the efficiency in terms of storage and manipulation, LiDAR data reduction is required in the process of DEM generation. Feature specific elements such as breaklines contribute significantly to DEM quality. Therefore, data reduction should be conducted in such a way that critical elements are kept while less important elements are removed. Given the high-density characteristic of LiDAR data, breaklines can be directly extracted from LiDAR data. Extraction of breaklines and integration of the breaklines into DEM generation are presented.},

	abstract = {Methods developed to process raster digital elevation models (DEM) automatically in order to delineate and measure the properties of drainage networks and drainage basins are being recognized as potentially valuable tools for the topographic parameterization of hydrological models. All of these methods ultimately rely on some form of overland flow simulation to define drainage courses and catchment areas and, therefore, have difficulty dealing with closed depressions and flat areas on digital land surface models. Some fundamental assumptions about the nature of these problem topographic features in DEM are implicit in the various techniques developed to deal with them in automated drainage analysis. The principal assumptions are: (1) that closed depressions and flat areas are spurious features that arise from data errors and limitations of DEM resolution; (2) that flow directions across flat areas are determined solely by adjacent cells of lower elevation; and (3) that closed depressions are caused exclusively by the underestimation of DEM elevations. It is argued that while the first of these assumptions is reasonable, given the quality of DEMs generally available for hydrological analysis, the others are not. Rather it seems more likely that depressions are caused by both under- and overestimation errors and that flow directions across flat areas are determined by the distribution of both higher and lower elevations surrounding flat areas. Two new algorithms are introduced that are based on more reasonable assumptions about the nature of flat areas and depressions, and produce more realistic results in application. These algorithms allow breaching of depression outlets and consider the distribution of both higher and lower elevations in assigning flow directions on flat areas. The results of applying these algorithms to some real and hypothetical landscapes are presented. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical technique for analyzing longitudinal channel profiles. Our technique is based on the integral approach to channel analysis: Drainage area is integrated over flow distance to produce a transformed coordinate, χ, which has dimensions of length. Assuming that profile geometry is conditioned by the stream power law, defined as E = KAmSn where E is erosion rate, K is erodibility, A is drainage area, S is channel gradient, and m and n are constants, the slope of a transformed profile in χ-elevation space should reflect the ratio of erosion rate to channel erodibility raised to a power 1/n; this quantity is often referred to as the channel steepness and represents channel slope normalized for drainage area. Our technique tests all possible contiguous segments in the channel network to identify the most likely locations where channel steepness changes and also identifies the most likely m/n ratio. The technique identifies locations where either erodibility or erosion rates are most likely to be changing. Tests on a simulated landscape demonstrate that the technique can accurately retrieve both the m/n ratio and the correct number and location of segments eroding at different rates where model assumptions apply. Tests on natural landscapes illustrate how the method can distinguish between spurious channel convexities due to incorrect selection of the m/n ratio from those which are candidates for changing erodibility or erosion rates. We also show how, given erosion or uplift rate constraints, the method can be used to constrain the slope exponent, n.},

These threshold conditions are determined by considering the channel heads observed across a portion of the study area and computing the related values of (1) drainage area A, (2) area-slope function AS2, with S being the local slope, and (3) Strahler order  of surface flow paths extracted from gridded elevation data. Attention is focused on the dependence of the obtained threshold values on the size of grid cells involved and on the ability of the identified threshold conditions to provide reliable predictions of channel heads across the entire study area. The results indicate that the threshold values of A, AS2, and  are all significantly dependent on grid cell size, and the uncertainty in the determination of threshold values of  is significantly smaller than that affecting the determination of threshold values of A and AS2. The comparison between predicted and observed channel heads indicates that the considered methods display variable reliability and sensitivity over different drainage basins and grid cell sizes, with a general tendency to predict more channel heads than can be observed in the field. Acceptable predictions are normally obtained where channel heads are formed essentially by surface runoff. More comprehensive methods seem, however, to be needed to predict channel heads affected by groundwater seeping upward.},

The accuracy and robustness of the method are illustrated using synthetic valley networks that mimic the complexities of real landscapes and for which the true drainage network is known exactly by construction. The method involves six principal steps: optimal Wiener filtering to remove microtopographic noise, mapping of the contour curvature, identification of valley heads using a user-defined contour-curvature threshold criterion, routing of a unit discharge of water from each valley head using a multiple-flow-direction routing algorithm, removal of discontinuous reaches from the drainage network using a user-defined discharge-per-upstream-valley-head threshold criterion, and thinning of the valley network to a single pixel width. The method yields accurate results using the same user-defined parameters for the two field sites considered in this study, suggesting that for DEMs with resolution of approximately 1 m, the method has the ability to produce accurate results for a variety of landscapes by using the same parameter values used in this study.},

We present an alternative approach based on an integration of the steady-state form of the stream power equation. The main component of this approach is a transformation of the horizontal coordinate that converts a steady-state river profile into a straight line with a slope that is simply related to the ratio of the uplift rate to the erodibility. The transformed profiles, called chi plots, have other useful properties, including co-linearity of steady-state tributaries with their main stem and the ease of identifying transient erosional signals.

It is often difficult to quantify the loss of soil because the footprint of individual gullies is too small to be captured by most generally available digital elevation models (DEMs), such as the USGS National Elevation Dataset. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has the potential to provide the required data density, but an even newer class of ground-based sensors may provide better local resolution at lower cost. In this study, we compared digital elevation models produced by airborne and ground-based LiDAR systems with ground-based geomorphic and geodetic survey data to determine their utility in quantifying volumetric soil loss due to gully erosion in a heavily degraded watershed (7.55 × 10− 2 km2), on southwestern Santa Cruz Island in southern California. Volumetric estimates of the eroded sediment were produced by comparing the LiDAR-derived DEMs of the gully system to a modeled pre-erosion surface. Average point densities were significantly higher for the ground-based LiDAR system and provided more detailed information; however, its limited scanning footprint and side-looking orientation presented serious challenges in collecting continuous data from deeply incised gullies, making the airborne system preferable for this type of investigation and likely for most applications where heavy topographic shadowing is prevalent.},

	abstract = {The complex interplay of biological, physical, and chemical processes in pedogenesis and hillslope evolution limits our ability to predict and interpret landscape dynamics. Here, we synthesize a suite of observations from the steep, forested Oregon Coast Range to analyze the role of trees in topographic modification and bedrock-to-soil conversion. Using topographic data derived from airborne lidar, we demonstrate that the topographic signature of forest-driven soil and bedrock disturbance is pervasive. For length scales greater than 7.5 m, the land surface is defined by ridge-valley landforms, whereas smaller scales are dominated by pit-mound features generated by the turnover of large coniferous trees. From field surveys, the volume of bedrock incorporated in overturned rootwads increases rapidly with diameter for large conifers, reflecting the highly nonlinear increase in root biomass with tree diameter. Because trees younger than 60 years detach negligible bedrock, short timber harvest intervals may limit the extent to which root systems penetrate bedrock and facilitate bedrock fracturing and biogeochemical weathering. Using ground-penetrating radar, we show that the rootwads of large trees root achieve substantial penetration (1–3 m) into shallow bedrock. The radar transects also reveal that variations in soil thickness have characteristic length scales of 1 to 5 m, consistent with the scale of large rootwads, indicating that both the landscape surface and soil-bedrock interface exhibit a biogenic imprint. In our study area, the residence time of bedrock within dense rooting zones directly below large trees is similar to the time required for trees to occupy the entire forest floor through multiple cycles of forest succession, suggesting that biological modification of shallow bedrock is ubiquitous. Given increases in erosion rate, the ability of roots to initiate soil production may decline as bedrock exhumation through the biotic zone is rapid relative to the time required for successive forests and their associated root systems to fracture bedrock. As a result, in rapidly eroding terrain the coupling between biotic and abiotic weathering processes (such as exfoliation fracturing) may dictate the maximum rate of bedrock-to-soil conversion.},

	abstract = {The development of high resolution LiDAR digital terrain models (DTMs) has enabled the exploration of the statistical signature of morphology on curvature distributions. This work analyzes Minimum Curvature distributions to identify the statistical signature of two types of LiDAR-DTM errors (outliers and striping artifacts) in the derived estimates, rather than morphology itself. The analysis shows the importance of modeling these errors correctly, in relation to the scale of analysis and DTM resolution, in order to have reliable curvature estimates. Nine DTMs of different morphological areas are considered, and grouped into a training dataset (without errors) and a test dataset (with errors). In the training dataset, the original DTMs are considered as true values; errors are then applied to these data. Minimum Curvature is computed at multiple scales from each DTM: changes in curvature distributions due only to morphology and scale are characterized from the original data; error effects are then identified from the datasets with simulated errors, and validated against the test dataset. The analysis shows that outliers and striping artifacts can be realistically simulated by heavily left tailed distributions. For DTMs without errors, the scale-dependent change in curvature distribution is primarily controlled by real morphology. When DTMs include errors, curvature distributions become controlled by these errors, whose propagation depends on error distribution, error spatial correlation, and the scale of analysis. This study shows that the curvature distributions are impacted upon differently by striping artifacts and outliers, and that these are clearly distinguishable from the signal of morphological features: a scale-dependent change in curvature distribution can therefore be interpreted as the signature of these specific errors, rather than morphology.

This procedure offers improvements over prior procedures that have restricted flow to eight possible directions (introducing grid bia) or proportioned flow according to slope (introducing unrealistic dispersion).

	abstract = {Light detection and ranging, or LiDAR, effectively produces products spatially characterizing both terrain and vegetation structure; however, development and use of those products has outpaced our understanding of the errors within them. LiDAR’s ability to capture three-dimensional structure has led to interest in conducting or augmenting forest inventories with LiDAR data. Prior to applying LiDAR in operational management, it is necessary to understand the errors in LiDAR-derived estimates of forest inventory metrics (i.e., tree height). Most LiDAR-based forest inventory metrics require creation of digital elevation models (DEM), and because metrics are calculated relative to the DEM surface, errors within the DEMs propagate into delivered metrics. This study combines LiDAR DEMs and 54 ground survey plots to investigate how surface morphology and vegetation structure influence DEM errors. The study further compared two LiDAR classification algorithms and found no significant difference in their performan..., Le lidar (la détection et la télémétrie par la lumière laser) peut servir à cartographier efficacement la morphologie du terrain et la structure de la végétation. Cependant, le développement et l’utilisation de ces cartes ont devancé notre compréhension des erreurs qu’elles contiennent. La capacité du lidar à cartographier la structure tridimensionnelle de la végétation a suscité un intérêt pour réaliser ou étoffer les inventaires forestiers à l’aide de données lidar. Toutefois, avant d’appliquer le lidar dans la gestion opérationnelle, il est nécessaire de comprendre les erreurs d’estimation des métriques d’inventaire forestier dérivées du lidar (comme la hauteur des arbres). La plupart des métriques d’inventaire forestier dérivées du lidar exigent la création de modèles numériques de terrain (MNT). Comme ces métriques sont calculées à partir de la morphologie du terrain, les erreurs dans les MNT se propagent dans les métriques qui sont produites.

	abstract = {Identification and removal of surface depressions is a critical step for automated modelling of surface rainfall runoff based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At present, nearly all GIS and hydrologic software packages employ Jenson and Domingue's method for preparing depressionless DEMs for hydrologic analysis. This conventional method is computationally intensive and time‐consuming. With the growing availability of high‐resolution DEMs produced by airborne LIDAR and InSAR techniques, GIS‐based hydrologic applications often need to handle larger geographic areas at finer resolutions. In the face of high‐resolution DEMs, the conventional method becomes inadequate and deficient. In this paper, we present a new method for efficiently identifying and filling surface depressions in DEMs. This method can simultaneously determine flow paths and spatial partition of watersheds with one pass of processing. A novel concept of spill elevation and the least‐cost search for optimal flow paths are the two cornerstones of our method. The time complexity of our method is in O(Nlog N). It has been implemented using C++ programming language and successfully applied to USGS DEMs and LIDAR DEMs of various sizes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional method by a factor of over 30, in terms of running time.},

	abstract = {• Background and Aims Petals are important for Primula sieboldii because of the commercial value of its flowers, and their form is a target characteristic for breeding. An appropriate understanding of petal form in terms of genetic mechanisms and environmental effects is necessary for improvement of this species. The aim of this study was to establish a quantitative evaluation method of petal shape by elliptic Fourier descriptors and principal component analysis (EF–PCA), and thus to investigate genotypic and environmental effects on petal morphology.
• Methods EF–PCA describes an overall shape mathematically by transforming coordinate information concerning its contours into elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) and summarizing the EFDs by principal component analysis. To examine varietal effects on principal component (PC) scores and petal area among commercial varieties, nested ANOVAs were performed (since the samples had a hierarchical structure with four sources, i.e. variety, plant, flower and petal).
• Key Results Petal shape variation could be evaluated successfully and the symmetrical and asymmetrical elements of the overall shape variation could be detected. The proportions of the variance component due to varietal differences were more than 70 \% in the first five PCs of the symmetrical elements and petal area. By contrast, the proportions due to varietal effects of all PCs of the asymmetrical elements were less than 20 \%, and the proportions of the variation within a flower were more than 75 \%. It was also demonstrated that the yearly variance of petal shape was small, and that of petal area was large.
• Conclusions Within a flower the major source of the symmetrical elements is genotypic and the asymmetrical elements are strongly affected by the environment. With respect to petal area, the contribution of genotypes is also large; it is, however, affected by the macro-environment more notably than is petal shape.},

We mapped debris flows and debris deposits using a light-detecting and ranging digital elevation model, remote imagery and field studies integrated in a geographic information system. Evidence of past debris flows was found at all recent debris flow sites. Orographic rainfall enhancement along topographic escarpments influenced debris flow frequency at higher elevations. A possible trigger for the Wayah and fatal Peeks Creek debris flows was a spiral rain band within Ivan that moved across the area with short duration rainfall rates of 150-230 mm/h. Intersecting bedrock structures in polydeformed metamorphic rock influence the formation of catchments within structural-geomorphic domains where debris flows originate.},

	abstract = {Hillslopes are thought to poorly record tectonic signals in threshold landscapes. Numerous previous studies of steep landscapes suggest that large changes in long-term erosion rate lead to little change in mean hillslope angle, measured at coarse resolution. New LiDAR-derived topography data enables a finer examination of threshold hillslopes. Here we quantify hillslope response to tectonic forcing in a threshold landscape. To do so, we use an extensive cosmogenic beryllium-10 (10Be)-based dataset of catchment-averaged erosion rates combined with a 500 km2 LiDAR-derived 1 m digital elevation model to exploit a gradient of tectonic forcing and topographic relief in the San Gabriel Mountains, California. We also calibrate a new method of quantifying rock exposure from LiDAR-derived slope measurements using high-resolution panoramic photographs. Two distinct trends in hillslope behavior emerge: below catchment-mean slopes of 30°, modal slopes increase with mean slopes, slope distribution skewness decreases with increasing mean slope, and bedrock exposure is limited; above mean slopes of 30°, our rock exposure index increases strongly with mean slope, and the prevalence of angle-of-repose debris wedges keeps modal slopes near 37°, resulting in a positive relationship between slope distribution skewness and mean slope. We find that both mean slopes and rock exposure increase with erosion rate up to 1 mm/a, in contrast to previous work based on coarser topographic data. We also find that as erosion rates increase, the extent of the fluvial network decreases, while colluvial channels extend downstream, keeping the total drainage density similar across the range. Our results reveal important textural details lost in 10 or 30 m resolution digital elevation models of steep landscapes, and highlight the need for process-based studies of threshold hillslopes and colluvial channels.

Plots of drainage area versus slope for these mountain ranges exhibit substantial scatter that complicates comparison of range form to analytical theories and landscape evolution models. Contour plots of the density of such data reveal an attractor at the scale of the transition from hillslope processes to channel processes, and log-bin averaging reveals trends that parallel predictions of steady-state erosion laws but with different rate laws for five distinct process domains: hillslopes, valley heads, and colluvial, bedrock, and alluvial valley segments. Slope histograms computed for 100 km2 areas (defined by a 10 × 10 km grid) throughout the OM exhibit approximately normal or exponential distributions in areas of active rock uplift and depositional topography, respectively. Local slope distributions in the OCR also tend to be normally distributed, but some are left-skewed in areas with gentler slopes. Mean slopes determined both over the above referenced grid and a 10-km diam moving window are relatively invariant in the core of the OM in spite of strong contrasts in bedrock erodibility and gradients in long-term rock uplift rates. In contrast, the mean slopes in the OCR parallel latitudinal gradients in rock uplift rates and bedrock erodibility. Hence, the slope distributions in the OM and OCR reflect distinct relationships between development of threshold bedrock and soil-mantled hillslopes and steady-state topography.},

 abstract = {Distinct bedrock hollows with a colluvial fill are common in soil-mantled hillslopes. It has been proposed that these hollows are sites of recurrent emptying by landsliding and subsequent slower refilling with colluvium. On a hillslope in Northern California we have quantified the time since emptying and the three-dimensional configurations of the underlying bedrock surface. Correlation of the pollen record in the colluvium with a nearby pollen core from a lake with an accurate age control indicates that the oldest colluvium was deposited 11,000 to 13,500 years in the bedrock hollow. Since then deposition of colluvium in the hollow has been equivalent to 1.5 m of landscape lowering in the surrounding source area and to a local lowering rate of about 0.1 mm/yr. The longitudinal profile of the hollow is concave upward, a form that causes the groundwater flow to rise toward the surface downslope, leading to saturation and possibly to landsliding.},

Hollows are sites of topographically induced convergence and deposition of colluvial debris, and evacuation of this debris was apparently more thorough and possibly more frequent in the latest Pleistocene, perhaps due to a combination of changes in vegetation and rainfall characteristics. One hypothesis is that greater storm intensities occurred in the latest Pleistocene and induced a higher frequency of landslides in hollows and a regional extension of channel heads upslope relative to the Holocene. During the latest Pleistocene, California hollows apparently contained smaller volumes of colluvium in storage. The increased storage of debris during the Holocene may have resulted in a diminished supply of sediment to stream channels.},

	abstract = {Landscapes are shaped by the uplift, deformation and breakdown of bedrock and the erosion, transport and deposition of sediment. Life is important in all of these processes. Over short timescales, the impact of life is quite apparent: rock weathering, soil formation and erosion, slope stability and river dynamics are directly influenced by biotic processes that mediate chemical reactions, dilate soil, disrupt the ground surface and add strength with a weave of roots. Over geologic time, biotic effects are less obvious but equally important: biota affect climate, and climatic conditions dictate the mechanisms and rates of erosion that control topographic evolution. Apart from the obvious influence of humans, does the resulting landscape bear an unmistakable stamp of life? The influence of life on topography is a topic that has remained largely unexplored. Erosion laws that explicitly include biotic effects are needed to explore how intrinsically small-scale biotic processes can influence the form of entire landscapes, and to determine whether these processes create a distinctive topography.},

	abstract = {One of the most striking examples of self-organization in landscapes is the emergence of evenly spaced ridges and valleys. Despite the prevalence of uniform valley spacing, no theory has been shown to predict this fundamental topographic wavelength. Models of long-term landscape evolution can produce landforms that look realistic, but few metrics exist to assess the similarity between models and natural landscapes. Here we show that the ridge-valley wavelength can be predicted from erosional mechanics. From equations of mass conservation and sediment transport, we derive a characteristic length scale at which the timescales for erosion by diffusive soil creep and advective stream incision are equal. This length scale is directly proportional to the valley spacing that emerges in a numerical model of landform evolution, and to the measured valley spacing at five field sites. Our results provide a quantitative explanation for one of the most widely observed characteristics of landscapes. The findings also imply that valley spacing is a fundamental topographic signature that records how material properties and climate regulate erosional processes.},

	abstract = {Many landscapes are composed of ridges and valleys that are uniformly spaced, even where valley locations are not controlled by bedrock structure. Models of long-term landscape evolution have reproduced this phenomenon, yet the process by which uniformly spaced valleys develop is not well understood, and there is no quantitative framework for predicting valley spacing. Here we use a numerical landscape evolution model to investigate the development of uniform valley spacing. We find that evenly spaced valleys arise from a competition between adjacent drainage basins for drainage area (a proxy for water flux) and that the spacing becomes more uniform as the landscape approaches a topographic equilibrium. Valley spacing is most sensitive to the relative rates of advective erosion processes (such as stream incision) and diffusion-like mass transport (such as soil creep) and less sensitive to the magnitude of a threshold that limits the spatial extent of stream incision. Analysis of a large number of numerical solutions reveals that valley spacing scales with a ratio of characteristic diffusion and advection timescales that is analogous to a Péclet number. We use this result to derive expressions for equilibrium valley spacing and drainage basin relief as a function of the rates of advective and diffusive processes and the spatial extent of the landscape. The observed scaling relationships also provide insight into the cause of transitions from rill-like drainage networks to branching networks, the spatial scale of first-order drainage basins, the contributing area at which hillslopes transition into valleys, and the narrow range of width-to-length ratios of first-order basins.},

	abstract = {We conducted a series of four physical modeling experiments of mountain growth at differing rates of uplift and three distinct climates ranging from relatively wet to relatively dry. The spatial and temporal pattern of landscape behavior is characterized by ∼f−1 scaling in sediment discharge and power law scaling in the magnitude and frequency of ridge movement in all four experiments. We find that internally generated self-organized critical (SOC) processes generate dynamically stable catchment geometries after ∼1 relief depths of erosion: these regularly spaced catchments have an average outlet-spacing ratio of 2.16, well within the range of values reported in field studies. Once formed, large catchment bounding ridges oscillate about a critically balanced mean location, with occasional large-scale changes in catchment size. Ridge movement appears to be driven by the competition for discharge as landslides push ridges back and forth. These dynamics lead to the emergence of a complex twofold scaling in catchment dynamics that is fully established by 1.8 relief depths of erosion; at this stage, a clear threshold has emerged separating two distinct scaling regimes, where large ridge mobility is insensitive to relief and small ridge mobility is relief dependent. Overall, we demonstrate that the development of dynamically stable large-scale landforms is related to the emergence of a complex-system hierarchy in topographic dynamics. Once formed, these landscapes do not evolve; statistical properties such as average topography and discharge become stationary while topography remains highly dynamic at smaller length scales.},
